<h1>Informaiton Retrieval and Applications, Spring 2014</h1>
This course offers an introduction to the principles and concepts in information
retrieval (IR), which is fundamental to modern Web search engines.
<br>In addition to Web search, other applications of information retrieval
systems will also be described.
<br>This year, the course is offered at graduate-level as well as the International Graduate Program in College of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (EECS). It's taught in English.

If you cannot successfully submit your work, please contact with the TA or the instructor.


<h3> Homeworks </h3>

There will be about 2 programming homeworks that target at different IR tasks.
<ol>
<li><a href="http://140.124.180.182/IR_Spring14/HW/HW1.ppt">HW#1</a>: Vector Space Retrieval (Indexing and Search)
<br>Due: <b>Apr. 18, 2014</b>
<ul>
<li><b>Test collection</b>:
ClueWeb09 dataset will be used as your test collection.
Each team will be randomly assigned one partial WARC file, which contains about 10,000 Wab pgaes in 1GB.
Before obtaining the test data file, you can first get the <a href="http://www.digitalpreservation.gov/formats/fdd/fdd000236.shtml

and <a href="http://boston.lti.cs.cmu.edu/clueweb09/wiki/tiki-index.php?page=Sample+Files">a sample file from ClueWeb09 dataset</a>
to develop/test your prototype system.
<li>You can check <a href="http://140.124.183.31/en0000/">the assigned list of test data files</a>. 
Note that there's an upper limit of network traffic for the server,
please download *ONLY ONE* assigned file for your team. 
If you need all these files, please contact with the TA.
