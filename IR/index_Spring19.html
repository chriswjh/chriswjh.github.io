<h1>Informaiton Retrieval and Applications, Spring 2019</h1>
This course offers an introduction to the principles and concepts in information
retrieval (IR), which is fundamental to modern Web search engines.
<br>In addition to Web search, other applications of information retrieval
systems will also be described.
<br>This year, the course is offered at graduate-level as well as the International Graduate Program in College of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (EECS). It's taught in English.
