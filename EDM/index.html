<h1>Educational Data Mining and Applications, Fall 2025</h1>
This course is one of the advanced courses in the Micro Courses on Educational Big Data. It introduces the basic concepts and principles of data mining, including: data preprocessing, frequent pattern mining, classification, and clustering. Also, students need to use tools such as Weka and Python for educational big data analytics. With the programming exercises and term project, students will be able to learn the fundamental ideas of educational data analysis and real applications with practical tools.
<br>The course is offered at undergraduate level.

<h2>Notes on online recording of course sessions</h2>
All students enrolled in this course will be added to the team in Microsoft Teams for the corresponding course number.
<br>
The channel of the course in Microsoft Teams has been created: [Course Number: 348012].
