<h1>Educational Data Mining and Applications, Fall 2023</h1>
This course is one of the advanced courses in the Micro Courses on Educational Big Data. It introduces the basic concepts and principles of data mining, including: data preprocessing, frequent pattern mining, classification, and clustering. Also, students need to use tools such as Weka and Python for educational big data analytics. With the programming exercises and term project, students will be able to learn the fundamental ideas of educational data analysis and real applications with practical tools.
<br>The course is offered at undergraduate level.
