<h2>Homework Assignments, Labs, and Term Project (for the second part)</h2>
During the progress of the course, there will be several homework assignments for written exercises, and also some hand-on labs in class.


<h3> Homeworks </h3>
There will be about 3 written assignments for topics such as pattern mining, classification, and clustering.

<ol>
<li>
HW#1
:Ch.2-3
<br>Due: <b>Nov. 14, 2019</b>
<li>
HW#2
:Ch.6
<br>Due: <b>Dec. 12, 2019</b>

</ol>

Please hand in your assignment before deadline according to the following instructions. <br>

<h4>Submission Instructions</h4>
<b>NOTE</b>: Programs or projects in electronic files must be submitted directly to the website.
<p>
If you cannot successfully submit your work, please contact with the instructor.

<h3> Labs </h3>
Due to the background of students this semester, it will be difficult to give hands-on labs or programming exercises in different platforms such as Spark and Jupyter Notebook.

</ul>

<h3> Term Project </h3>
Instead, you are required to complete a term project in which open datasets can be anayzed using open source tools.
<br>[NOTE] If you haven't submitted your proposal, please do so as soon as possible since we are arranging the presentation schedule.
