<h1>Big Data Mining and Applications, Spring 2018</h1>
This course discusses issues in scalable mining of big data in various applications, which is gaining more popularity in recent years.
<br>The major focus in this course will be utilizing parallel progamming in distributed platforms for efficient mining of different kinds of big data.
<br>The course is offered at graduate-level, and will be taught in English.

<p>
[*** NOTE ***]: This course is <em>NOT</em> an introductory course for undergraduates.
You are required to take the first course of "Introduction to Big Data Analytcis" or "Data Mining" in the undergraduate-level as as prerequisite.
<br><b>It contains very heavy loads of parallel programming, which is a totally different concept from sequential programming</b>.
<br>Please think twice before taking this course!

<p>
Please read the <a href="http://140.124.180.184/Course/BDM_Spring18/slides/Notes.pptx">notes to the course</a> very carefully about the requirements for the programming homework and quiz.

<h2> Programming Assignments and Projects</h2>
Please hand in your assignment before deadline according to the following instructions. <br>

<h3>Program Submission Instructions</h3>
<b>NOTE</b>: Programs or projects in electronic files must be submitted directly to the TA online at 
<a href="http://mslin.ee.ntut.edu.tw">Open Cyber Classrooms</a>.

<br>Please follow the instructions before your first login for this course.
<ul>
<li> <b>Account</b>: Use your <em>student ID</em> as the account and password at your first login. Please change the password *as soon as possible* for better security.
<ul>
  <li><em>Note</em>: Even if you already have accounts for other courses, you are still *required* to do it for this course.
</ul>
<li> <b>Filename</b>: Compress your source code, output, documents, and related files into one compressed file. Please name it according to your ID and each homework. For example, [id]_HW1.zip.
</ul>

<p>
If you cannot successfully submit your work, please contact with the TA or the instructor.

<h3>Distributed Programming Environment</h3>
You can use your own computers, or virtual machines on any cloud computing services to setup your distributed programming environment for this course.

<ol>
<li><b>Computers</b>:
<br>You can build your own distributed environment by commodity computers.
Usually, Hadoop/Spark does not require very poweful capability of each machine.
<li><b>VMs on the cloud</b>:
<br>You can use existing cloud computing services from Google, Amazon, or Microsoft Azure to setup distributed environemnt.
Most cloud services provide free quota for limited usage (CPU, memory, network bandwidth, storage).
<li><b>VMs on CSIE server</b>:
See the following section for more details.
</ol>

<h3>VM Application on CSIE server</h3>

To service the undergraduate students who might not have fixed computers to complete the homework, students might apply for the virtual machines on CSIE server.

<br>Please read the <a href="http://140.124.180.184/Course/BDM_Spring18/slides/VM-rules.pptx">Rules for VM Application</a> before applying this service.

<ul>
<li>Quota: 2 VMs per student
<li>VM Specification:
<ul>
<li>Hardware: 4 CPU, 2GB RAM, 40GB storage
<li>OS: ubuntu 16.04 64-bit
</ul>
<li>Contact: jack888835  AT  GMail DOT Com
</ul>

<p>
<em>Important Notes</em>
<ul>
<li>By applying this service, you agree to follow the rules of Taipei Tech and academic networks.
<li>Since a single IP address is shared among VMs on the server, an upper limit on the network traffic of 10GB/day will be enforced by the computer center.

<li>Due to the limited physical memory size (64GB) on CSIE server, at most <b>15</b> applications will be granted in a first-come-first-serve manner except that:
Requests from undergraduate students without any lab equipment are given higher priority.

</ul>

<h3> Homework </h3>

There will be about five programming exercises (and some written exercises) that target at different data analysis tasks.
<br><b>Given large dataset, all homeworkas require parallel programming using either Hadoop or Spark, in <em>distributed mode</em>.</b>
<br>Since it's totallly different from sequential programming, it takes much more efforts and time to complete.
Please think twice before taking this course!
