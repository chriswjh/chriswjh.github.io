<h1>Big Data Mining and Applications, Fall 2025</h1>
This course discusses issues in scalable mining of big data in various applications, which is gaining more popularity in recent years.
<br>The major focus of this course will be utilizing parallel progamming in distributed platforms for efficient mining of different kinds of big data.
<br>The course is offered at graduate-level, and will be taught in English.

<p>
<h2>Notes on Online Sessions of this Course</h2>
All students enrolled in this course will be added to the teams in Microsoft Teams for the corresponding course numbers: 347338, 350369.
<br>
The channel to use for the team in this course Big Data Mining [course number: 350369]. 

<p>
<b>[NOTE]</b> For those who really cannot attend the class in person due to some unforeseeable reasons, you could join the corresponding online sessions in Teams.
During course sessions, remember to sign up your name and student ID in Teams, when the TA will remind you.

<p>
Please read the notes to the course very carefully about the requirements for the programming homework and quiz.

[*** NOTE ***]: This course is <em>NOT</em> an introductory course for undergraduates.
You are strongly suggested to take the first course of "Introduction to Big Data Analytcis" or "Data Mining" in the undergraduate-level as a prerequisite.
<br><b>It contains very heavy loads of parallel programming, which is a totally different concept from sequential programming</b>.
<br>Please think twice before taking this course!

<h2> Programming Assignments and Projects</h2>
Please hand in your assignment before deadline according to the following instructions. <br>

<h3>Program Submission Instructions</h3>
<b>NOTE</b>: Programs or projects in electronic files must be submitted directly to the TA online at 
iSchool+.

<p>
If you cannot successfully submit your work, please contact with the TA or the instructor.

<h3>Distributed Programming Environment</h3>
You can use your own computers, or virtual machines on any cloud computing services to setup your distributed programming environment for this course.

<ol>
<li><b>Computers</b>:
<br>You can build your own distributed environment by commodity computers.
Usually, Hadoop/Spark does not require very poweful capability of each machine.
<li><b>VMs on the cloud</b>:
<br>You can use existing cloud computing services from Google, Amazon, or Microsoft Azure to setup distributed environemnt.
Most cloud services provide free quota for limited usage (CPU, memory, network bandwidth, storage).
</ol>


<h3> Homework </h3>

There will be about 5 programming exercises (and some written exercises) that target at different data analysis tasks.
<br><b>Given large datasets, all homeworks require parallel programming using either Hadoop or Spark, in <em>distributed mode</em>.</b> (for CS students)
<br>Since it's totallly different from sequential programming, it takes much more efforts and time to complete.
Please think twice before taking this course!

<p>
In the case of very large datasets, you still need to analyze all data objects in the whole dataset. 
Please design your program accordingly to first partition the data into several batches, and then merge the final result.
<ol>
<li>

      <li><em>source code, installation/execution instructions,
      team members and task responsibility</em> (for system projects)
